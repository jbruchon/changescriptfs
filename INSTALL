Just type "make" and then "make install".

DESTDIR may be specified to install elsewhere: make DESTDIR=/pkg install

A script "chroot_build.sh" is provided which will perform builds in your own
local chroot build environments and makes tar.xz package files for each one
specified at the top of the script. This is handy for supporting multiple C
libraries and varying machine bit sizes.
