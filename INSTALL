Just type "make" and then "make install".

DESTDIR may be specified to install elsewhere: make DESTDIR=/pkg install

If your compiler doesn't support LTO, remove "-flto" from Makefile and try
compiling again. ntreg still contains code that changescriptfs may not use and LTO
removes this dead code from the final program.

A script "chroot_build.sh" is provided which will perform builds in your own
local chroot build environments and makes tar.xz package files for each one
specified at the top of the script. This is handy for supporting multiple C
libraries and varying machine bit sizes.
