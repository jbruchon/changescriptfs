FIXME: Write this README when the FS is working

This is an overlay FUSE filesystem tracks write and delete operations
and writes out a shell script with each operation. File writes cannot
be directly tracked, so they are replaced with "echo" commands which
can then be rewritten later if desired (or ignored.)

An example session:

$ mount.changescriptfs /home/user /mnt

$ cd /mnt

$ ls
file1      ABC

$ mv file1 file2

$ ln file2 XYZ

$ ln -f file2 ABC

$ rm file2

$ cd /

$ umount /mnt


The resulting script output would be:

#!/bin/sh

mv file1 file2
rm ABC
ln file2 ABC
ln file2 XYZ
rm file2
